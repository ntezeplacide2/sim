 Weather is atmospheric conditions occurs in given area over a given period of time and climate change refers to the long-term regional or global average of temperature,
 humidity and rainfall patterns over given period of time. Climate change is the average weather condition that has come to define Earth’s local regional and global climate.
 These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term. Human activities like burning fossil, 
 oils preservation heavy industries increase heat-trapping greenhouse gas level in earth atmosphere, these human-produced temperature 
 increase are commonly referring to as global warming. Nature facts also contribute to climate change like earth vibration here 
 we can say ocean patterns, El Nino, La Nina as well. External forms can cause this change also here we can say volcanic activities.
 The different scientist from ground, space and air theoretical model to monitor and study past, present and future climate change data records
 the evidence of climate change key indicators global land and ocean temperature increase, rising sea level ice loss, at earth’s poles and in mountain glaciers,
 frequency and severity changes in hurricane,
 heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, floods and precipitation and cloud vegetation covers, to name but a few.</h3>

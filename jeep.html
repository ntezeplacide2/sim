<p>Taj Mahal, the magnificent monument that stands at the heart of India has a story that has been melting the hearts of millions of listeners since the time Taj has been visible.
 A story, that although ended back in 1631,
 continues to live on in the form of Taj and is considered a living example of eternal love.
 It's the love story of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, two people from the course of history who set an example for the people living in present and the future to come.
 An English poet, Sir Edwin Arnold best describes it as "Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are,
 but the proud passion of an emperor's love wrought in living stones." The story that follows next will prove why the statement is true.</p>

Shah Jahan, initially named Prince Khurram, was born in the year 1592. He was the son of Jehangir,
 the fourth Mughal emperor of India and the grandson of Akbar the Great. In 1607 when strolling down the Meena Bazaar, accompanied by a string of fawning courtiers,
 Shah Jahan caught a glimpse of a girl hawking silk and glass beads. It was love at first sight and the girl was Mumtaz Mahal, who was known as Arjumand Banu Begum at that time.
 At that time, he was 14 years old and she, a Muslim Persian princess, was 15. After meeting her, Shah Jahan went back to his father and declared that he wanted to marry her. 
 The match got solemnized after five years i.e., in the year 1612.</p

<p>It was in the year 1628 that Shah Jahan became the Emperor and entrusted Arjumand Banu with the royal seal.
 He also bestowed her with the title of Mumtaz Mahal, meaning the "Jewel of the Palace". Though Shah Jahan had other wives also, 
 but, Mumtaz Mahal was his favorite and accompanied him everywhere, even on military campaigns. In the year 1631,
 when Mumtaz Mahal was giving birth to their 14th child, she died due to some complications. While Mumtaz was on her deathbed,
 Shah Jahan promised her that he would never remarry and will build the richest mausoleum over her grave.</p>

<p>It is said that Shah Jahan was so heartbroken after her death that he ordered the court into mourning for two years.
 Sometime after her death, Shah Jahan undertook the task of erecting the world's most beautiful monument in the memory of his beloved.
 It took 22 years and the labor of 22,000 workers to construct the monument. When Shah Jahan died in 1666,
 his body was placed in a tomb next to the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. 
 This magnificent monument came to be known as "Taj Mahal" and now counts amongst the Seven Wonders of the World.
 This is the true story of the Taj Mahal of India, which has mesmerized many people with its bewitching beauty.</p
